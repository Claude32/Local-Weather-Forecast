# Local-Weather-Forecast
 A website that forecasts weather for Davis and nearby cities. The
computer version of the page shows the local weather forecast within six hours
with corresponding weather icon, doppler map, local time and current temperature.
The user can use the search box to switch cities. The mobile version hides the
weather forecast within six hours by default and the corresponding weather icon.
The user clicks the arrow below to un-hide with an animation. The front-end is
built using native CSS3/Flexbox, while the back-end is built using node.js.
